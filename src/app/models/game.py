        Customized word search puzzle generator.
        If the puzzle is generated successfully, return the puzzle 2D array, words to find, and the key.
        Otherwise, an error will be raised.

        Usage
        ---
        - If the words are given, use the given words, level, size, and include_all_words. 
        If include_all_words is True, the puzzle will try to put all the words in the puzzle. 
        If it cannot put all the words in, it will raise an error: MissingWordsError.
        Otherwise, it will put as many words as possible in the puzzle.

        - If the words are not given, use random words, given level and size.
        Ideally, the puzzle will put level * 2 + 1 words in the puzzle.
        If the puzzle cannot put all the words in, it will put as many words as possible in the puzzle.

        Args:
            words: A list of words to be put in the puzzle, separated by comma as described in the WordSearch class.
            level: The difficulty level of the puzzle, from 1 to 3.
            size: The size of the puzzle, from 5 to 50.
            include_all_words: Whether to include all the words in the puzzle.

        Returns:
            A tuple of (puzzle, words, key) if the puzzle is generated successfully.
